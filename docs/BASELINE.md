# Baseline

The numbers every milestone has to beat, measured on the reference engine. Re-measure
with `bench/baseline.sh` (after `bench/build-openjk.sh`); it opens a game window for
about 30 seconds per run, so it refuses to start while the PC is in use (input in
the last 2 minutes) unless `SWJKJA_ALLOW_WINDOW=1` is set.

## Reference

OpenJK at the revision pinned in ROADMAP.md, Release x64 (MSVC), vanilla renderer,
reading the retail Steam assets. Not the retail `jamp.exe`: on this PC it crashes on
every map load (see DECISIONS.md, 2026-10-07).

Settings: windowed 1280x720, `r_swapInterval 0`, `com_maxfps 0`, sound muted,
otherwise defaults.

## Machine

Intel Core i5-7400T (4 cores, 2.4 GHz), Intel HD Graphics 630 (driver
31.0.101.2141), Windows, game on drive D:.

## Results, 2026-10-07

| Demo | FPS (median) | FPS (each run) | Load, warm (s) | Load, cold (s) |
|------|--------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|
| ffa3 | 197.4 | 197.4 200.8 189.8 199.2 194.4 | 19.67 | 22.38 |

- **ffa3** (`bench/demos/ffa3.dm_26`): multiplayer map `mp/ffa3`, eight bots in a
  free-for-all, camera following one bot, 59 seconds, 1183 snapshots.
- **FPS** is `timedemo`: the demo plays as fast as possible, one snapshot per frame.
- **Load** is `CL_InitCGame` as the engine logs it: loading the map, models, sounds
  and textures until the first frame. The cold run is the first after building; warm
  runs reuse the OS file cache.

## Reading the retail assets (swjkja-fs), 2026-10-07

`cargo run --release -p swjkja-fs --example read_all -- <GameData> <threads>` reads
and checks (CRC-32) every one of the 22,775 files: 3,049 MB uncompressed from the
1.2 GB of `.pk3` archives. Indexing all four archives takes 30-170 ms.

| Archives on | 1 thread | 4 threads |
|-------------|----------|-----------|
| Internal NVMe (C:) | 9.0, 9.7 s | 4.6, 5.1 s |
| USB drive (D:, Sabrent) | 9.7, 20.4 s | 12.2, 14.3 s |

- From NVMe, one thread is limited by decompression (about 330 MB/s of output on
  this 2.4 GHz CPU); four threads give about 2x, not 4x.
- From the USB drive, parallel reads at scattered offsets are slower than one
  thread, and the 7.9 GB of RAM cannot keep all 1.2 GB cached between runs.
- **So the loader should read each archive in offset order on one thread and spread
  only the decompression over the cores.** Loading a map needs a few hundred MB, not
  all 3 GB; this is the full-read upper bound.

## Parsing the retail maps (swjkja-bsp), 2026-10-07

`cargo run --release -p swjkja-bsp --example parse_all -- <GameData>` reads and
parses all 57 maps (521 MB) and checks every cross-reference in them: 15-24 ms per
map to parse (3 runs), after 30-45 ms per map to read it from the USB drive. A
first version took 67-85 ms per map because it formatted an error message for every
check, not just failing ones.

## Decoding the retail textures (swjkja-image), 2026-10-07

All 5,875 textures decode: 4,271 JPEG, 1,134 PNG, 470 TGA. Compared with reference
decodes (`bench/images/reference.py`: Pillow 12.3 with libjpeg-turbo and libpng, and
a hand-written TGA decoder that follows the original's rules):

| Format | Files | Identical pixels | Largest difference |
|--------|-------|------------------|--------------------|
| TGA | 470 | 470 | none |
| PNG | 1,134 | 1,134 | none |
| JPEG | 4,271 | 35 | 5 of 255 levels; mean 0.077, 13% of pixels differ (sample of 303 files) |

The JPEG differences come from the decoder's inverse DCT and chroma upsampling;
`jpeg-decoder` differs too (4,238 files). They are below what the original shows
anyway: with its default `r_ext_compress_textures 1`, the original has the driver
re-compress every texture to S3TC/DXT, which changes pixels far more. See
DECISIONS.md.

To rerun the comparison (Windows Python with Pillow and numpy in
`%USERPROFILE%\.swjkja\venv`):

    cargo run --release -p swjkja-image --example decode_all -- <GameData> > ours.tsv
    python bench/images/reference.py <GameData> > ref.tsv

## Loading the retail shader scripts (swjkja-shader), 2026-10-07

`cargo run --release -p swjkja-shader --example shader_report -- <GameData>`: 68
files, 3,365 shader definitions (both counts cross-checked with a separate Python
count). Loading and indexing all scripts takes 17-21 ms; parsing every definition
9-11 ms (3 runs). The 40 the original rejects are all editor and compiler-only
shaders (caulk, clip, hint, nodraw, ...) without drawing stages. An early version took
1.8 s to parse: each parse rescanned the whole 2 MB text for NUL bytes.

## Building map surfaces (swjkja-world), 2026-10-07

`cargo run --release -p swjkja-world --example build_all -- <GameData>` builds the
drawable surfaces of all 57 maps (patch subdivision, stitching, LOD sync) in 1.20 s;
the slowest is `taspir2` at 141 ms (156 stitches). Comparing patches only within
their LOD group (identical results) took this from 1.84 s. `mp/ffa3`: 4,426 faces,
88 triangle soups, 526 patches (2 `nodraw`, skipped), 100 stitches.

## Visual comparison with the reference, 2026-10-07

`bench/capture-reference.sh` renders the 11 views in `bench/reference/views.txt`
(3 multiplayer maps) with the reference OpenJK, world only, full-quality textures
(the owner's choice: `r_picmip 0`, no texture compression), 1280x720; the reference
build has a test-only patch pinning the camera exactly (`cg_swjkjaView`).
The `render_world` example renders the same views with the new renderer and
`bench/reference/compare.py` compares them.

First comparison, with stand-in shading (base texture x lightmap):

| View | Mean difference (0-255) | Pixels off by > 16 |
|------|------|------|
| ffa3_down | 1.09 | 0.3% |
| ctf4_spawn1 | 1.58 | 0.7% |
| ffa3_spawn2 | 2.44 | 4.9% |
| ffa3_up | 2.66 | 1.5% |
| ctf4_up | 5.25 | 15.2% |
| ffa3_spawn3 | 6.40 | 15.0% |
| duel5_spawn1 | 6.72 | 20.6% |
| duel5_spawn2 | 6.95 | 15.3% |
| duel5_down | 8.18 | 25.3% |
| ctf4_spawn2 | 8.51 | 30.1% |
| ffa3_spawn1 | 18.07 | 42.7% |

Geometry and camera line up exactly (edges match in every view). The large
differences are surfaces whose shaders brighten or blend in extra stages (for
example a `GL_DST_COLOR GL_SRC_COLOR` stage doubles brightness), plus the sky, which
the preview does not draw: the shader-stage system is next.

With the stage renderer (materials resolved and drawn stage by stage as the
original does; no sky or fog yet), 2026-10-07:

| View | Mean difference | Pixels off by > 16 |
|------|------|------|
| duel5_down | 0.08 | 0.0% |
| ffa3_down | 0.16 | 0.0% |
| ffa3_up | 0.21 | 0.1% |
| duel5_spawn1 | 0.24 | 0.1% |
| ffa3_spawn2 | 0.27 | 0.0% |
| ffa3_spawn3 | 0.40 | 0.1% |
| ffa3_spawn1 | 0.53 | 0.1% |
| ctf4_spawn1 | 0.53 | 0.0% |
| duel5_spawn2 | 1.29 | 2.1% |
| ctf4_up | 4.17 | 12.0% |
| ctf4_spawn2 | 7.42 | 28.7% |

`ctf4` has global fog (a teal haze growing with distance), which is not drawn yet;
the remaining `duel5_spawn2` difference is mostly sky (5.7% of the view undrawn).

With global fog (GL_EXP2 on eye-space depth, per-stage fog colours, clear to the fog
colour), 2026-10-07: `ctf4_spawn1` 0.16, `ctf4_spawn2` 0.23 (from 7.42), `ctf4_up`
0.32 (from 4.17), all with 0.0% of pixels off by more than 16. Ten of the eleven
views are now within 0.53 on average; `duel5_spawn2` (1.29) is the undrawn sky.

With the sky (outer box and cloud layers), 2026-10-07: no view has more than 0.1%
undrawn; `duel5_spawn2` 1.23 (2.0% of pixels off), where the rest is glow sprites
(`deformVertexes autoSprite`), which come with deforms.

With flares (screen-facing glows with the original's depth test), 2026-10-07:
`duel5_spawn2` 0.24 with 0.0% of pixels off. **All eleven views are within 0.53 on
average, with at most 0.1% of pixels off by more than 16.**

| View | Mean difference | Pixels off by > 16 |
|------|------|------|
| duel5_down | 0.08 | 0.0% |
| ctf4_spawn1 | 0.16 | 0.0% |
| ffa3_down | 0.16 | 0.0% |
| duel5_spawn1 | 0.20 | 0.0% |
| ffa3_up | 0.21 | 0.1% |
| ctf4_spawn2 | 0.23 | 0.0% |
| duel5_spawn2 | 0.24 | 0.0% |
| ffa3_spawn2 | 0.27 | 0.0% |
| ctf4_up | 0.32 | 0.0% |
| ffa3_spawn3 | 0.40 | 0.1% |
| ffa3_spawn1 | 0.53 | 0.1% |

These are still single moments: the reference shots were taken at an unknown game
time, so animated stages (waves, scrolls, animMaps) can only match by chance; the
next reference capture should pin the time.

## Not measured yet

- **Frame-time spikes** (1% lows): `timedemo` reports only the average. Needs
  per-frame timing, either PresentMon (requires admin rights) or a frame-time log
  added to the reference build.
- **Single-player**: the SP engine has no `timedemo`; it needs a scripted camera
  path or save-game route.
- **Linux**: the reference runs on Windows only so far.
