# Baseline

The numbers every milestone has to beat, measured on the reference engine. Re-measure
with `bench/baseline.sh` (after `bench/build-openjk.sh`); it opens a game window for
about 30 seconds per run.

## Reference

OpenJK at the revision pinned in ROADMAP.md, Release x64 (MSVC), vanilla renderer,
reading the retail Steam assets. Not the retail `jamp.exe`: on this PC it crashes on
every map load (see DECISIONS.md, 2026-10-07).

Settings: windowed 1280x720, `r_swapInterval 0`, `com_maxfps 0`, sound muted,
otherwise defaults.

## Machine

Intel Core i5-7400T (4 cores, 2.4 GHz), Intel HD Graphics 630 (driver
31.0.101.2141), Windows, game on drive D:.

## Results, 2026-10-07

| Demo | FPS (median) | FPS (each run) | Load, warm (s) | Load, cold (s) |
|------|--------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|
| ffa3 | 197.4 | 197.4 200.8 189.8 199.2 194.4 | 19.67 | 22.38 |

- **ffa3** (`bench/demos/ffa3.dm_26`): multiplayer map `mp/ffa3`, eight bots in a
  free-for-all, camera following one bot, 59 seconds, 1183 snapshots.
- **FPS** is `timedemo`: the demo plays as fast as possible, one snapshot per frame.
- **Load** is `CL_InitCGame` as the engine logs it: loading the map, models, sounds
  and textures until the first frame. The cold run is the first after building; warm
  runs reuse the OS file cache.

## Reading the retail assets (swjkja-fs), 2026-10-07

`cargo run --release -p swjkja-fs --example read_all -- <GameData> <threads>` reads
and checks (CRC-32) every one of the 22,775 files: 3,049 MB uncompressed from the
1.2 GB of `.pk3` archives. Indexing all four archives takes 30-170 ms.

| Archives on | 1 thread | 4 threads |
|-------------|----------|-----------|
| Internal NVMe (C:) | 9.0, 9.7 s | 4.6, 5.1 s |
| USB drive (D:, Sabrent) | 9.7, 20.4 s | 12.2, 14.3 s |

- From NVMe, one thread is limited by decompression (about 330 MB/s of output on
  this 2.4 GHz CPU); four threads give about 2x, not 4x.
- From the USB drive, parallel reads at scattered offsets are slower than one
  thread, and the 7.9 GB of RAM cannot keep all 1.2 GB cached between runs.
- **So the loader should read each archive in offset order on one thread and spread
  only the decompression over the cores.** Loading a map needs a few hundred MB, not
  all 3 GB; this is the full-read upper bound.

## Not measured yet

- **Frame-time spikes** (1% lows): `timedemo` reports only the average. Needs
  per-frame timing, either PresentMon (requires admin rights) or a frame-time log
  added to the reference build.
- **Single-player**: the SP engine has no `timedemo`; it needs a scripted camera
  path or save-game route.
- **Linux**: the reference runs on Windows only so far.
